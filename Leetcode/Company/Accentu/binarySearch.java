public class binarySearch {

    /*
    The function accepts a string str as its argument. The string str consists of binary digits
    separated with an alphabet as follows:

        – A denotes AND operation
        – B denotes OR operation
        – C denotes XOR Operation
        You are required to calculate the result of the string str, scanning the string to right taking one opearation at a time, and return the same.

        Note:

        No order of priorities of operations is required
        Length of str is odd
        If str is NULL or None (in case of Python), return -1
        Input:
        str: 1C0C1C1A0B1

        Output:
        1

        Explanation:
        The alphabets in str when expanded becomes “1 XOR 0 XOR 1 XOR 1 AND 0 OR 1”, result of the expression becomes 1, hence 1 is returned.
